# MATLAB_plotter

This is a MATLAB script to be used to make latex complient figures. 
This script uses setFigoptions to be called before figure; in matlab to set the parameters. 
Then once the figure is plotted use saveFig(height,width,filename) and the script will create figures that are EPS to be used in latex that are complient with IEEE standards for latex files and figures.
